## Summary



## Comunity

- We have a discord server. This should be your first stop to talk with other Algebra students. Why don't you introduce yourself right now? [Join the AlgebraStudents Discord](https://discord.gg/[]).
- You can also interact through GitHub issues. If there is a problem with a course, this is the place to start the conversation.
- Note: This is an repository run by **students** for **studens**. There might be things done the wrong way, things that don't work or things that are unmaintained or deprecated. We try our best to keep things tidy!
